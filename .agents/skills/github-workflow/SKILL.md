# GitHub Issue Sync & PR Workflow Rules

When planning or implementing new features, you must use the automated JSON-driven issue sync tool located at `scripts/gh-issue-sync.cjs` to synchronize your task checklist with the GitHub issue tracker.

## 1. Tool Setup & Location
- Script: `scripts/gh-issue-sync.cjs` (executable Node.js script)
- Sample Config: `scripts/issues.sample.json`

## 2. Issue Tracking Workflow
Before writing code for any feature or logic change:
1. **Plan & Draft**: Create a temporary JSON file (e.g., `scripts/feature-xyz-plan.json`) containing the Epic description and target sub-issues. Follow the schema defined in `scripts/issues.sample.json`.
2. **Dry Run**: Preview the CLI commands that will run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/gh-issue-sync.cjs scripts/feature-xyz-plan.json --dry-run
   ```
3. **Apply & Link**: Generate the Epic and sub-issues on GitHub:
   ```bash
   node scripts/gh-issue-sync.cjs scripts/feature-xyz-plan.json
   ```
   *Note: The script automatically links all sub-issues to the parent Epic.*

## 3. Resolving and Closing Tasks
- **Pull Request Flow (Preferred)**: When your tasks are tied to code changes, do **NOT** set `"completed": true` in the JSON. Leave it as `false`. Instead, include `Closes #<issue-number>` in your Pull Request body or commit message so GitHub automatically closes the issue when the PR merges.
- **Manual/Standalone Tasks**: ONLY for operational tasks that do NOT involve a PR (e.g. running scripts, config changes), you may set `"completed": true` and run the sync utility again:
   ```bash
   node scripts/gh-issue-sync.cjs scripts/feature-xyz-plan.json
   ```
   *The utility will automatically detect the completed state, post a reference comment with the current git commit hash, and forcefully close the issue on GitHub.*
